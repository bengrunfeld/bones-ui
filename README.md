# Bones Dev

Bones Dev is a showcase app for the bones-ui library, which is an accessibilty compliant bare-bones UI library that uses react-hook-form.

Other UI frameworks like Material UI are highly opinionated as far as CSS and behavior goes, so I thought it would be helpful to create a UI library that has absolutely **no CSS or non-essential Javascript** in it, and was very customizeable as far as looks and functionality.

Enjoy!
